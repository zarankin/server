Assignment 3
Published on: 18/12/2018
Due date: 6/1/2019
Responsible TA’s: Linoy Barel, Matan Drory
1 General Description
In this assignment you will implement a simple social network server and client. The
communication between the server and the client(s) will be performed using a binary
communication protocol. A registered user will be able to follow other users and post
messages. Please read the entire document before starting.
The implementation of the server will be based on the Thread-Per-Client (TPC) and
Reactor servers taught in class. The servers, as seen in class, only support pull
notifications. Any time the server receives a message from a client it can replay back to
the client itself. But what if we want to send messages between clients, or broadcast an
announcment to a group of clients? We would like the server to send those messages
directly to the client without reciveing a request to do so. this behaviour is called push
notifications. The first part of the assignment will be to replace some of the current
interfaces with new interfaces that will allow such a case. Note that this part changes the
servers pattern and must not know the specific protocol it is running. The current server
pattern also works that way (Generics and interfaces).
Once the server implementation has been extended you will have to implement an
example protocol. The BGS (Ben Gurion Social) Protocol will emulate a simple social
network. Users need to register to the service. Once registered, they will be able to post
messages and follow other users. It is a binary protocol that uses pre defined message
length for different commands. The commands are defined by an opcode, a short number
at the start of each message. For each command, a different length of data needs to be
read according to it’s specifications. In the following sections we will define the
specifications of the commands supported by the BGS protocol.
Unlike real social network you will not work with real databases. You will need to save
data (Users, Passwords, Messages, ect...). You only need to save information from the
time the server starts and keep it in memory until the server closes.
1.1 Establishing a client/server connection
Upon connecting, a client must identify himself to the service. A new client will issue a
Register command with the requested user name and password. A registered client can
then login using the Login command. Once the command is sent, the server will reply on
the validity of the username and password. Once a user is logged in successfully, he can
submit other commands. The register and login commands are stated in the following
section. Note that the register command will not perform aotumatic login (you will need
to call login after it).
1.2 Supported Commands
The BGS protocol supports various commands needed in order to share posts and
messages. There are two types of commands, Server-to-Client and Client-to-Server. The
commands begin with 2 bytes (short) to describe the opcode. The rest of the message will
be defined specifically for each command as such:

2 bytes Length defined by command
Opcode …
We supplied functions that encode \ decode between 2 bytes and short for both java and
C++ in the assignment page.
The BGS protocol supports 11 types of messages:
• 1-8 are Client-to-Server messages
• 9-11 are Server-to-Client messages
Opcode Operation
1 Register request (REGISTER)
2 Login request (LOGIN)
3 Logout request (LOGOUT)
4 Follow / Unfollow request (FOLLOW)
5 Post request (POST)
6 PM request (PM)
7 User list request (USERLIST)
8 Stats request (STAT)
9 Notification (NOTIFICATION)
10 Ack (ACK)
11 Error (ERROR)
REGISTER Messages:
Messages have the following format:
2 bytes string 1 byte string 1 byte
Opcode Username 0 Password 0
Messages that appear only in a Client-to-Server communication.
A REGISTER message is used to register a user in the service. If the username is already
registerd in the server, an ERROR message is returned. If successful an ACK message will
be sent in return. Both string parameters are a sequence of bytes in UTF-8 terminated by
a zero byte (also known as the ‘\0’ char).
Parameters:
• Opcode: 1.
• Username: The username to register in the server.
• Password: The password for the current username (used to log in to the server).
Command initiation:
• This command is initiated by entering the following text in the client command
line interface: REGISTER <Username> <Password>
LOGIN Messages:
Messages have the following format:
2 bytes string 1 byte string 1 byte
Opcode Username 0 Password 0
Messages that appear only in a Client-to-Server communication.
A LOGIN message is used to login a user into the server. If the user doesn’t exist or the
password doesn’t match the one entered for the username, sends an ERROR message. An
ERROR message should also appear if the current client has already succesfully logged in.
Both string parameters are a sequence of bytes in UTF-8 terminated by a zero byte.
Parameters:
• Opcode: 2.
• Username: The username to log in the server.
• Password: The password for the current username (used to log in to the server).
Command initiation:
• This command is initiated by entering the following text in the client command
line interface: LOGIN <Username> <Password>
LOGOUT Messages:
Messages have the following format:
2 bytes
Opcode
Messages that appear only in a Client-to-Server communication. Informs the server on
client disconnection. Client may terminate only after reciving ACK message in replay. If no
user is logged in, sends an ERROR message.
Parameters:
• Opcode: 3.
Command initiation:
• This command is initiated by entering the following text in the client command
line interface: LOGOUT
• Once the ACK command is received in the client, it must terminate itself.
FOLLOW Messages:
Messages have the following format:
2 bytes 1 byte 2 bytes String
Opcode Follow/Unfollow NumOfUsers UserNameList
Messages that appear only in a Client-to-Server communication. A FOLLOW message
allows a user to add/remove other users to/from his follow list.
The user names inside the UserNameList parameter are seperated by a zero byte, and this
parameter ends with a terminating zero byte.
If the FOLLOW command failed for all users on the list (I.e. number of succesfull un /
follows = 0) an ERROR message will be sent back to the client.
The user must be logged in, otherwise an ERROR message will be sent.
For a follow command to succeed, a user on the list must not already be on the following
list of the logged in user. (The opposite also applys for the unfollow command).
The ack for this command will contain the number of successful follows/unfollows and
the corresponding user names. The user names inside the UserNameList parameter are
seperated by a zero byte, and this parameter ends with a terminating zero byte. (Those
will appear in the optional per command section of the ACK message).
The ACK message will have the following form:
ACK-Opcode FOLLOW-Opcode n <username1> … <username n>
2 bytes 2 bytes 2 bytes String 1 byte
ACK Opcode FOLLOW
Opcode
NumOfUsers UserNameList 0
Parameters:
• Opcode: 4.
• Follow/Unfollow: This parameter has a value of 0 when a user wants to follow,
otherwise it has a value of 1(Unfollow).
• NumOfUsers: The amount of users on the follow/unfollow list.
• UserNameList: The requested user names list to follow/unfollow.
Command initiation:
• This command is initiated by entering the following texts in the client command
line interface:
FOLLOW <0/1 (Follow/Unfollow)> <NumberOfUsers> <UserName_1> … <UserName_n>
POST Messages:
Messages have the following format:
2 bytes String 1 byte
Opcode Content 0
Messages that appear only in a Client-to-Server communication. A post message allows
a user to share messages with other users.
The Content parameter is a sequence of bytes in UTF-8.
All posts should be saved to a data structure in the server, along with PM messages. A 
post message will be sent to users who are listed with a “@username” inside the message
(if username is registered in the system) and to users following the user who posted the
message.
In order to send a POST message the user must be logged in, otherwise an ERROR message
will be returned to the client.
Parameters:
• Opcode: 5.
• Content: The content of the message a user wants to post. The message may
contain @<username> in order to send it to specific users other then those
following the poster.

Command initiation:
• This command is initiated by entering the following texts in the client command
line interface:
POST <PostMsg>
PM Messages:
Messages have the following format:
2 bytes String 1 byte String 1 byte
Opcode UserName 0 Content 0
Messages that appear only in a Client-to-Server communication.
PM message is used to sent private messages to another user.
Both string parameters are a sequence of bytes in UTF-8 terminated by a zero byte.
In order to send a PM message the sending user must be logged in, otherwise an ERROR
message will be returned to the client.
If the reciepient username isn’t registered an ERROR message will be returned to the
client.
@<userName> isn’t applicable for private messages.
All pm messages should be saved to a data structure in the application, along with post
messages.
Parameters:
• Opcode: 6.
• UserName: The user to send the message to.
• Content: The content of the message the logged in user wants to send to the other
user.
Command initiation:
• This command is initiated by entering the following texts in the client command
line interface:
PM <UserName> <Content>
USERLIST Messages:
Messages have the following format:
2 bytes
Opcode
A USERLIST message is used to recieve a list of all registered users.
Messages that appear only in a Client-to-Server communication.
In order to send a USERLIST message the user must be logged in, otherwise an ERROR
message will be returned to the client.
The ACK message for this command will contain the number of users, and a list of
UserNames seperated by zero bytes ending with a zero byte in the optional section. The
list is ordered by registration order.
Example:
ACK-Opcode USERLIST-Opcode n <UserName 1> … <UserName n>
2 bytes 2 bytes 2 bytes String 1 byte
ACK Opcode USERLIST Opcode NumOfUsers UserNameList 0
Parameters:
• Opcode: 7.
Command initiation:
• This command is initiated by entering the following texts in the client command
line interface: USERLIST
STAT Messages:
Messages have the following format:
2 bytes String 1 byte
Opcode UserName 0
A STAT message is used to recieve data on a certain user (number of posts a user posted,
number of followers, number of users the user is following).
The UserName parameter are a sequence of bytes in UTF-8 terminated by a zero byte.
Messages that appear only in a Client-to-Server communication.
In order to send a STAT message the user must be logged in, otherwise an ERROR message
will be returned to the client.
If userName is not registered, an error message will be returned.
The returned ACK message will contain number of posts a user posted (not including
PM’s), number of followers, number of users the user is following in the optional section
of the ACK message.
Example:
ACK-Opcode USERLIST-Opcode <NumPosts> <NumFollowers> <NumFollowing>
2 bytes 2 bytes 2 bytes 2 bytes 2 bytes
ACK Opcode STAT Opcode NumPosts NumFollowers NumFollowing
Parameters:
• Opcode: 8.
• UserName: The User Name whose stats will be returned to the client.
Command initiation:
• This command is initiated by entering the following texts in the client command
line interface: STAT <userName>
NOTIFICATION Messages:
Messages have the following format:
2 bytes 1 byte String 1 byte String 1 byte
Opcode NotificationType - PM/Public PostingUser 0 Content 0
Messages that appear only in a Server-to-Client communication. This message will be sent
from the server for any PM sent to the user, post sent by someone the user is following,
or a post that contained @<MyUserName> in the content of a message.
Both string parameters are a sequence of bytes in UTF-8 terminated by a zero byte.
A user will recive any POST/PM notification sent after follow (for users the current user is
following) that he didn’t see. I.e. wasn’t logged in when the other user posted/sent the
message. (Clue: for each user, save timestamp of last message recieved from each of the
other users / timestamp of the follow command)
Parameters:
• Opcode: 9.
• NotificationType : indicates whether the message is a PM message (0) or a public
message (post) (1).
• PostingUser: The user who poster/sent the message.
• Content: The message that was posted/sent.
Client screen output:
• Any NOTIFICATION message received in client sould be written to the screen:
NOTIFICATION <”PM”/”Public”> <PostingUser> <Content>
ACK Messages:
Messages have the following format:
2 bytes 2 bytes -
Opcode Message Opcode Optional
Messages that appear only in a Server-to-Client communication.
ACK Messages are used to acknowledge different Messages. Each ACK contains the
message number for which the ack was sent. In the optional section there will be
additional data for some of the Messages (if a message uses the optional section it will be
specified under the message description).
All Messages that appear in a Client-to-Server communication require an ack/error
message in response.
Parameters:
• Opcode: 10.
• Message Opcode: The message opcode the ACK was sent for.
• Optional: changes for each message.
Client screen output:
• Any ACK message received in client sould be written to the screen:
ACK <Message Opcode> <Optional>
• Printing of the optional part:
o Multi-parameter optional sections should be split by space and printed by
order of the ack response
o Short should be printed as numbers
o String lists should be seperated by a space
ERROR Messages:
Messages have the following format:
2 bytes 2 bytes
Opcode Message Opcode
Messages that appear only in a Server-to-Client communication.
An ERROR message may be the acknowledgment of any other type of message. In case of
error, an error message should be sent.
Parameters:
• Opcode: 11.
• Message Opcode: The message opcode the ERROR was sent for.
Error Notification:
• Any error message received in client should be written to screen:
ERROR <Message Opcode>
2 Implementation Details
2.1 General Guidelines
• The server should be written in Java. The client should be written in C++ with
BOOST. Both should be tested on Linux installed at CS computer labs.
• You must use maven as your build tool for the server and MakeFile for the c++
client.
• The same coding standards expected in the course and previous assignments are
expected here.
2.2 Server
You will have to implement a single protocol, supporting both the Thread-Per-Client and
Reactor server patterns presented in class. Code seen in class for both servers is included
in the assignment wiki page. You are also provided with 3 new or changed interfaces:
• Connections – This interface should map a unique ID for each active client
connected to the server. The implementation of Connections is part of the server
pattern and not part of the protocol. It has 3 functions that you must implement
(You may add more if needed):
o boolean send(int connId, T msg) – sends a message T to client represented
by the given connId
o void broadcast(T msg) – sends a message T to all active clients. This
includes clients that has not yet completed log-in by the BGS protocol.
Remember, Connections<T> belongs to the server pattern
implemenration, not the protocol!.
o void disconnect(int connId) – removes active client connId from map.
• ConnectionHandler<T> - A function was added to the existing interface.
o Void send(T msg) – sends msg T to the client. Should be used by send and
broadcast in the Connections implementation.
• BidiMessagingProtocol – This interface replacesthe MessagingProtocol interface.
It exists to support peer 2 peer messaging via the Connections interface. It
contains 2 functions:
o void start(int connectionId, Connections<T> connections) – initiate the
protocol with the active connections structure of the server and saves the
owner client’s connection id.
o void process(T message) – As in MessagingProtocol, processes a given
message. Unlike MessagingProtocol, responses are sent via the
connections object send function.
Left to you, are the following tasks:
1. Implement Connections<T> to hold a list of the new ConnectionHandler interface
for each active client. Use it to implement the interface functions. Notice that
given a connections implementation, any protocol should run. This means that you
keep your implementation of Connections on T.
public class ConnectionsImpl<T> implements Connections<T> {…}.
2. Refactor the Thread-Per-Client server to support the new interfaces. The
ConnectionHandler should implement the new interface. Add calls for the new
Connections<T> interface. Notice that the ConnectionHandler<T> should now
work with the BidiMessagingProtocol<T> interface instead of
MessagingProtocol<T>.
3. Refactor the Reactorserver to support the new interfaces. The ConnectionHandler
should implement the new interface. Add calls for the new Connections<T>
interface. Notice that the ConnectionHandler<T> should now work with the
BidiMessagingProtocol<T> interface instead of MessagingProtocol<T>.
4. Tasks 1 to 3 MUST not be specific for the protocol implementation. Implement
the new BidiMessagingProtocol and MessageEncoderDecoder to support the BGS
protocl as described in section 1.2. You will also need to define messages(<T> in
the interfaces). You may add more classes as neccesery to implement the protocol
(shared protocol data ect…).
Leading questions:
• Which classes and interfaces are part of the Server pattern and which are part of
the Protocol implementation?
• When and how do I register a new connection handler to the Connections
interface implementation?
• When do I call start to initiate the connections list? Start must end before any call
to Process occurs. What are the implications on the reactor? (Note: start cannot
be called by the main reactor thread and must run before the first )
• How do you collect a message? Are all message types collected the same way?
Tips:
• You can test tasks 1 – 3 by fixing one of the examples in the impl folder in the
supplied spl-net.zip to work with the new interfaces (easiest is the echo example)
• You can complete tasks 1 and 2, proceed to 4 and return to the reactor code later.
Thread per client implementation will be enough for testing purposes.
• The BGS protocol will require a shared object between client protocol 
implementation. You can transfer it in the constructor using the protocol factory.
(as seen in NewsFeedServerMain.java in the examples). This means you will also
need to consider synchronization from multiple clients working on the data
structures at the same time.
Testing run commands:
• Reactor server:
mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass=”bgu.spl.net.impl.BGSServer.ReactorMain” -
Dexec.args=”<port> <No of threads>”
• Thread per client server:
mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass=”bgu.spl.net.impl.BGSServer.TPCMain” -
Dexec.args=”<port>”
The server directory should contain a pom.xml file and the src directory. Compilation
will be done from the server folder using:
mvn compile
2.3 Client
An echo client is provided, but its a single threaded client. While it is blocking on stdin
(read from keyboard) it does not read messages from the socket. You should improve the
client so that it will run 2 threads. One should read from keyboard while the other should
read from socket. The client should receive the server’s IP and PORT as arguments. You
may assume a network disconnection does not happen (like disconnecting the network
cable). You may also assume legel input via keyboard.
The client should recive commands using the standard input. Commands are defined in
section 1.2 under command initiation sub sections. You will need to translate from
keyboard command to network messages and the other way around to fit the
specifications.
Notice that the client should close itself upon reception of an ACK message in response
of an outgoing LOGOUT command.
The Client directory should contain a src, include and bin subdirectories and a Makefile
as shown in class. The output executable for the client is named BGSclient and should
reside in the bin folder after calling make.
Testing run commands: BGSclient <ip> <port>
3 Submission instruction
• Submission is done only in pairs. If you do not have a pair, find one. You need
explicit authorization from the course staff to submit without a pair. You cannot
submit in a group larger than two.
• You must submit one .tar.gz file with all your code. The file should be named
"ID#1_ID#2.tar.gz". Note: We require you to use a .tar.gz file. Files such as .rar,
.zip, .bz, or anything else which is not a .tar.gz file will not be accepted and your
grade will suffer.
• Extension requests are to be sent to majeed. Your request email must include the
following information:
- Your name and your partners name.
- Your id and your partners id.
- Explanation regarding the reason of the extension request.
- Offcial certification for your illness or army drafting.
Requests without a compelling reason will not be accepted
• The submitted file should contain a Client directory and a Server directory (Their
content was explained in the implementation section).
4 Examples
The following section contains examples of commands running on client. It assumes that
the software opened a socket properly and a connection has been initiated.
We use “CLIENT#No<” and “CLIENT#No>” to annotate client #No terminal input
(keyboard) \ output (screen print). The order of commands matches order of reception
in server. Server and client actions are explained in between.
Note that the examples do not show the actual structure of the network messages, just
the input \ output on the client terminal. The translation should be done according to
specifications in section 1.2.
4.1 Registeration and login
Server assumptions for example:
• Server currently has 1 registered user named “Morty” with password “a123”
CLIENT#1< LOGIN Morty a321
CLIENT#1> ERROR 2
(Failed because of wrong password)
CLIENT#1< LOGIN Rick a123
CLIENT#1> ERROR 2
(Failed because username Rick isn’t registered)
CLIENT#1< LOGIN Morty a123
CLIENT#1> ACK 2
CLIENT#2< LOGIN Morty a123
CLIENT#2> ERROR 2
(Failed because Morty is already logged-in)
CLIENT#2< USERLIST
CLIENT#2> ERROR 7
(Failed because client #2 isn’t logged in)
CLIENT#2< REGISTER Rick pain
CLIENT#2> ACK 1
CLIENT#1< LOGOUT
CLIENT#1> ACK 3
(client 1 closes)
CLIENT#2< LOGOUT
CLIENT#2> ERROR 3
(client 2 did not login)
4.2 Following and posting / PM
Server assumptions for example:
• Server currently has 3 registered users:
o “Morty” with password “a123”
o “Rick” with password “pain”
o “Bird-person” with password “Gubba”
• Followings:
o Morty follows Rick and Bird-person
o Rick follows Bird-person
CLIENT#1< LOGIN Morty a123
CLIENT#1> ACK 2
CLIENT#1< FOLLOW 0 2 Rick Bird-person
CLIENT#1> ERROR 4
(Tried to follow users that he already follows, since both failed an error returned)
CLIENT#2< LOGIN Bird-person Gubba
CLIENT#2> ACK 2
CLIENT#2< POST Gubba nub nub doo rah kah
CLIENT#2> ACK 5
CLIENT#1> NOTIFICATION Public Bird-person Gubba nub nub doo rah kah
(Morty follows bird-person and is online so he gets the message pushed)
CLIENT#3< LOGIN Rick pain
CLIENT#3> ACK 2
CLIENT#3> NOTIFICATION Public Bird-person Gubba nub nub doo rah kah
(Rick follows Bird-person, now that he logged-in he receives messages he missed)
CLIENT#3< PM Bird-person why aren’t you following me?
CLIENT#3> ACK 6
CLIENT#2> NOTIFICATION PM Rick why aren’t you following me?
(Bird-person is online and was sent a PM, it is pushed right away to him)
CLIENT#3< POST wubba lubba dub dub @Bird-person is not following me
CLIENT#3> ACK 5
CLIENT#1> NOTIFICATION Public Rick wubba lubba dub dub @Bird-person is not
following me
CLIENT#2> NOTIFICATION Public Rick wubba lubba dub dub @Bird-person is not
following me
(Bird-person receives rick’s latest post because his @username appears in it)
CLIENT#2< FOLLOW 0 2 Rick Mortneey
CLIENT#2> ACK 4 1 Rick
(Bird-person failed to follow Morty because he misspelled his name. Note that he
does not receive old rick messages from before the follow)
4.3 USERLIST \ STAT and unfollow
Server assumptions for example:
• Server currently has 3 registered users:
o “Morty” with password “a123”. Registered first
o “Rick” with password “pain”. Registered second
o “Bird-person” with password “Gubba”. Registered third
• Followings:
o Morty follows Rick and Bird-person
o Rick follows Bird-person
• Messages:
o Morty sent 2 posts and 3 PMs
o Rick sent 4 posts and 2 PMs
o Bird-person sent 1 post and 1 PM
CLIENT#1< LOGIN Morty a123
CLIENT#1> ACK 2
CLIENT#1< USERLIST
CLIENT#1> ACK 7 3 Morty Rick Bird-person
CLIENT#1< STAT Bird-person
CLIENT#1> ACK 8 1 2 0
CLIENT#1< POST @bird-person I will not follow you any more, you are not social
at all
CLIENT#1> ACK 5
(not one receives the post because bird person isn’t logged-in and no one follows
Morty, when bird person logs in he should get it)
CLIENT#1< FOLLOW 1 1 Bird-person
CLIENT#1> ACK 4 1 Bird-person
(Morty no longer follows bird-person and will not see his posts that do not
contain @Morty in them from now on)
CLIENT#1< STAT Bird-personaaaa
CLIENT#1> ERROR 8
(No such user Bird-personaaaa)
CLIENT#1< LOGOUT
CLIENT#1> ACK 3
(client 1 closes)
4.4 Keyboard command to packet
In this section we will show a few keyboard commands and their matching network
messages. Note that since network messages are just an array of bytes, we will print the
hex values of those byte array.
Reminder: A byte can be represented by 2 hexadecimal values (0 to f), each
representing 4 bits of the 8 in a single byte.
